This module defines the verifiers used for evaluating the quality of generated chains of thought.

It exports:
    - `default_verifier`: A default verifier instance.
    - `LLMJudgeVerifier`: A class for verifiers that use LLM to judge the quality of outputs.
    - `BaseVerifier`: An abstract base class for all verifiers.
