# CoT-Forge Examples

CoT Forge is a powerful library designed to facilitate the generation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning paths using large language models (LLMs). This README provides links to various examples that demonstrate how to use the library effectively. Each example is designed to showcase different features and capabilities of CoT Forge, making it easier for users to understand and implement the library in their own projects.

## Examples Directory
- [naive linear search](./naive_linear_search.ipynb): This example demonstrates the basic functionality of CoT Forge by using a naive linear search strategy to generate a single reasoning path. It serves as a starting point for understanding how to use the library and its core features.

- [beam search](./beam_search.ipynb): This example demonstrates how to use the Beam Search strategy for generating multiple reasoning paths simultaneously. It highlights the advantages of exploring multiple branches in the reasoning space, which can lead to more comprehensive and accurate results.

- [batch run](./batch_run.ipynb): This example illustrates how to process multiple questions in a batch, showcasing the efficiency and scalability of CoT Forge when dealing with large datasets.

- [custom strategy registry](./custom_strategy_registry.ipynb): This example shows how to create and register custom reasoning strategies, allowing users to design and test reasoning strategies tailored to their specific needs.
