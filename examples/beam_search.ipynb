    "# Beam Search Example\n",
    "This example demonstrates how to use the `BeamSearch` search algorithm with a simple reasoning task. The Beam Search algorithm is a heuristic search that explores a graph by expanding the most promising nodes in a limited set. Search is performed in a breadth-first manner, keeping track of the best candidates at each level. The algorithm continues until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a maximum number of steps or finding a satisfactory solution."
