# CoT Forge

A Python library for generating high-quality Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning data for training and fine-tuning large language models.

## Overview

CoT Forge helps you create synthetic training data that includes complex reasoning chains, enabling LLMs to learn more robust and transparent reasoning capabilities. Inspired by research like [HuatuoGPT-o1](https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/HuatuoGPT-o1), this library implements a flexible framework for:

* Creating verifiable question/answer pairs
* Finding optimal reasoning paths through tree search
* Converting rigid reasoning paths into natural language
* Formatting responses suitable for supervised fine-tuning

## Installation

CoT Forge is compatible with Python 3.9 and above. You can install it via pip or clone the repository directly.

```bash
# Install using pip
pip install cot-forge

# Or directly from the repository
pip install git+https://github.com/your-username/cot-forge.git
```

## Quick Start

```python
from cot_forge.llm import GeminiProvider
from cot_forge.reasoning import CoTBuilder, NaiveLinearSearch
from cot_forge.reasoning.verifiers import LLMJudgeVerifier

# Initialize LLM provider
llm = GeminiProvider(api_key="your-api-key")

# Setup CoT builder with essential components
builder = CoTBuilder(
    search_llm=llm,
    search=NaiveLinearSearch(max_depth=3),
    verifier=LLMJudgeVerifier(llm)
)

# Generate CoT reasoning for a question
question = "What is the capital of France, and why did it become the capital?"
ground_truth = "Paris is the capital of France. It became the capital due to its central location and political importance."

search_result = builder.build(
    question=question,
    ground_truth_answer=ground_truth,
)

# Access the best reasoning paths
successful_nodes = result.get_successful_terminal_nodes()
# Get the full chain of thought for a successful node as a dictionary
success_node = successful_nodes[0]
print(success_node.get_full_cot())

# Process reasoning into natural language for training
from cot_forge.post_processing.reasoning_processor import ReasoningProcessor

processor = ReasoningProcessor(
    llm_provider=llm, 
    dataset_name="my_dataset",
    search_name="naive_search"
)

processed = processor.process(
    question=question,
    cot=success_node.get_full_cot()
)

print(processed)
```
